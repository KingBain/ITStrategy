# Git account set-up
Get Git installed on your computer and sign up for a GitHub account if you do not already have one.  
* Install Git by submitting a request to National Service Desk  
* Configure Git using instructions provided here (Should I add the link to set-up git here)  
* Enable two factor authentication if required  
> In case you have enabled a two-factor authentication code for security, you may be required to create a personal access token. This token is used instead of your GitHub password (and the authentication code) wherever required through Git Bash.  

# How to start a project?
## Creating a repository 
* Click on "New" to create a new repository 
* Fill in the form that appears - entering name of the repository and description.
* Select “Public” to create a repository open to all for reading. Note that only those added as members can commit or make changes to the repository.
* Select “Initialize the repository with a README file” to get started with the basic documentation. README.md file is created automatically. This file is displayed when someone opens up the repository and can be used to give any instructions to those who are editing the repository.
> In case joining an ongoing project, ask the repository admin to add your GitHub account to the project and provide editing privileges. Next, jump to cloning the project on your computer.

## Creating a branch 
Each repository has a default master branch. In case you need to create new branches, create a branch using the branch menu selector on the GitHub repository page.

## Creating a fork
A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. To create a fork, click 'Fork' on the main page of the GitHub repository.

Once the fork is created, configure a remote pointing an upstream repository to sync any changes between the fork and the original repository. [Learn more](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork)

Sync the fork of a repository to keep it up-to-date with the upstream repository, as needed. [Learn more](https://help.github.com/en/articles/syncing-a-fork)
