# Create *Internal Tooling Team*

## Pretense 

Presently we have two developers, Shaun Laughland and Calvin Rodo, who are maintaining an unofficial [Developer Experience repository on Github](https://github.com/esdc-devx) in order to address the existing need to create a developer experience team. Given the size and scale of development taking place with in ESDC, it is recommended that an offical Internal Tooling Team be created in order to assist with unifying the toolset used by ESDC to properly leverage the benefits provided by economies of scale. 

## Justification 



## Current Situation 

ESDC has many silo'd developer groups (Ex: ...? ). IITB would greatly benefit from having one team who was able to deliver value to all developers by creating tools around a standardized set of core technologies. 

The knowledge gaps, and collaboration, between development teams within ESDC could be greatly improved if a team were introducted who had the expertise to assist with both standardizing the toolset in use at ESDC as well as increasing cooprer
